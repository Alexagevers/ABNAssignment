Dear reviewer,

Welcome to this Playwright Testing Framework!

This project will contain a tests covering the most basic functionality of the login feature of the Single Page Application. 

In tests/login.spec.ts you will find 5 test cases: 1 happy flow, and 4 unhappy flows. Not everything is implemented into the application yet, but after some discussion I think we should think of implementing those as well. With these extra implementation I hope we can make the application a little bit more user friendly.

In tests/visual-test.spec.ts there are 2 tests using Applitools to cover both some visual testing of the application on different devices and browsers as well as covering the functionality itself on those different platforms.

Please have a look at it. I am really happy to receive any feedback you can give me!
